# snake
A snake game written in Lua using the löve framework

## How to play
This plays like every snake game I know of. Use the arrow keys to turn your snake around, eat the green things to make points.
F1 toggles debug info, if you're into that.

NOTE: You need löve to play this. Get it at http://love2d.org. You can run it at the game's folder or make a zip out of it and rename the extension to `.love` (then double click to run).
